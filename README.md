# Assignment1-B211-Password Generator
This repository contains the assignment 1 that I have done in the INFO-B211, data analysis, mining, and visualization, class.


This is a Python-based password generator developed for Assignment1 for INFO-B 211 class.
The main goal of this project is to practice utilizing Python's built-in standard modules in a real-world scenario while reinforcing core programming concepts like modular design, user input handling, and file operations.

The program generates two types of passwords: random and memorable, and then the program logs each of the generated passwords along with the time it was created.
